# Shepaug School Auto Schedule Tool

## Project Summary

This is a tool made by me because the new schedule is way too complicated for anyone to remember. This tool takes a list of all of you classes and formats them into a schedule for the current day. It even takes into account the differences between the middle school and high school schedules. The tool currently supports regular days, advisory days, early release days, and extended Spartan Period days.

## How to use

The Shepaug School Auto Schedule Tool is designed to be easy to use. The first time you visit the site, the schedule will be prefilled with placeholder class names and set to high school mode. If you want to change the class names, class colors, or high school status, click on the day type located at the top of the page in large bold letters. This opens the preferences menu. Fill out the Period 1-7 fields with the names of you classes. You can even other information like room numbers and teacher names if you want to. If you are in middle school, uncheck the box next to "HS?". Pressing the "Apply Settings" button will reload the tool with the preferences that you chose. If you bookmark the page, you will not lose you preferences when you open the bookmark since all the data is stored in the URL.

### Inline HTML

The settings menu allows you to write in custom text for class names, but you can also use HTML as class names. Some examples of this would be using a `<span>` element to add multiple colors to your class name or using an `<a>` element to add a hyperlink. The possibilities are endless. Since the text box size is relatively small, it is reccomended that you write your HTML inside of an external text editor and paste it in.
